              EON Coffee Shop was born from a simple dream: to create a space where coffee lovers 
              could gather, relax, and enjoy the perfect cup of coffee. Founded in 2020, we have 
              been dedicated to sourcing the finest coffee beans from around the world and crafting 
              each cup with love and precision.
